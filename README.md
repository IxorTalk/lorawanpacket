Full credit for this library goes to []Romain Cambier](https://github.com/cambierr)

A Java library to parse LoRaWan packets forked from https://github.com/cambierr/lorawanpacket.
This is a forked repo to get the most recent code from https://github.com/cambierr/lorawanpacket into Maven Central to use the lorawanpacket library in our projects in a controlled way.
At the time of writing, the latest code from the library is [not available on Maven Central yet](https://github.com/cambierr/lorawanpacket/issues/3).
